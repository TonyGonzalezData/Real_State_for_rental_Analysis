# Real_State_to_Rent_analysis
Real estate market analysis of the city of La Coruña, with the goal of investing in residential properties for long-term rental.

## Objective

The main objective is to identify properties in the city of La Coruña that allow us to maximize profitability by renting them out as long-term residential accommodations.

To achieve this, we divide the project into two main parts:

•	Discovery: Data analysis aimed at identifying insights that clarify which patterns we should focus on when looking for an investment property (guided by the current housing supply and rental demand).

•	Reporting: Creating a dashboard that enables detailed analysis of the most relevant metrics to determine whether a district or property meets our general criteria for profitability and available investment capital. It also provides access to the URLs of these 
properties, allowing the operator to conduct a deeper analysis.


## About the Dataset

The data was collected through web scraping (Octoparse app, CSV format) from two websites:

•	Idealista.com: A list of properties available for sale in La Coruña was collected (including URL, address, price, parking, number of rooms, and square meters).

•	Fotocasa.es: The average rental price per square meter for each district in La Coruña was collected.

The data was then cleaned, organized, and merged in the analytical datamart creation phase.
